# STREAMS 
STREAMS (Self-Training Robotic End-to-end Adaptive Multimodal Shared autonomy) is a deep reinforcement learning framework that combines environment data and user input to produce smooth, stable end-effector trajectories for assistive robots, achieving a 96% success rate in simulations and 83% in user studies without requiring pre-existing datasets.

## Key Features of STREAMS

- **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DQN)**: STREAMS leverages a DQN pipeline for adaptive and self-training control of end-effector based assistive robots.
- **Multimodal Input Integration**: Combines synthetic user inputs and real-time environment data to generate smooth, robust trajectories.
- **Zero-Shot Sim-to-Real Transfer**: Achieves high task performance without the need for pre-existing datasets or extensive user data collection.
- **Synthetic Data for Training**: By using synthetic data during the training phase, STREAMS eliminates the need for any pre-existing datasets.
- **Trajectory Stabilization**: Significant improvements in trajectory smoothness and control, with a 96% success rate in simulations.
- **Assistive Mode Performance**: Demonstrates an 83% success rate in user studies, with enhanced task performance and user satisfaction in real-world scenarios.

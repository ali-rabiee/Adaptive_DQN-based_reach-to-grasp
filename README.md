# STREAMS 
STREAMS (Self-Training Robotic End-to-end Adaptive Multimodal Shared autonomy) is a deep reinforcement learning framework that combines environment data and user input to produce smooth, stable end-effector trajectories for assistive robots, achieving a 96% success rate in simulations and 83% in user studies without requiring pre-existing datasets.
